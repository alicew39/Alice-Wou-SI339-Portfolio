            <p>My name is Alice Wou and I am a current junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Analysis. Under the School of Information, I have developed both hard and soft skills, from coding, data analysis, and web development, to communication, collaboration and problem solving. I’m passionate about working on projects that will be useful and transformative in everyday life for users and my interests are related to the development of human-computer interaction technology and how said components can help the world run more efficiently.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2022 where I can further develop the technical skills I have been taught in my Data Manipulation class and Web Development class. I also hope to learn new technical skills which will be useful after I graduate. I am eager to learn new skillsets and excited to work again next summer and see what projects I can contribute to.</p>
